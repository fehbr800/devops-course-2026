## 2. Abstract

- **Context:**  
In software development environments, the use of integration testing metrics helps reveal points of productivity loss and, consequently, time waste. This creates a clear need to define and apply countermeasures that mitigate such bottlenecks, preventing delays in final delivery and preserving overall process efficiency. Identifying the most effective testing tools is especially relevant for financial institutions, where informed tool selection improves productivity and avoids inefficient experimentation with low-impact alternatives.
  Within this scenario, the use of metrics in integration testing becomes a strategic approach for understanding the performance of the change-validation process. The analysis of these metrics enables teams to identify bottlenecks, improve testing efficiency, and provide faster feedback to development teams. Therefore, understanding how metrics can be used to optimize change-validation time in DevOps pipelines is essential for improving software quality and increasing development-process efficiency.
- **Objectives:** Clear statement of the main objectives. 
  - Analysis of test architectures used by fintech companies, including tests between microservices, integration with databases, payment APIs, and external services.
  - Analysis of tools used for integration test automation, as well as tools related to security, compliance, and monitoring within DevOps pipelines.
  - Analysis of metrics related to pipeline performance, such as test execution time, total pipeline duration, feedback time for developers, and frequency of test failures.
- **Methods:** Summary of the methods used, including:
  - This study was conducted as a systematic literature review based on bibliographic research, including analysis of scientific articles, technical documentation, and technical reports. The primary data source was Google Scholar, searched using structured query strings combining terms related to fintech, DevOps pipelines, integration testing, and performance metrics. The search was restricted to articles published between 2022 and 2025, written in English, and categorized as review articles. Applying these filters, 16 articles were identified. Studies were then screened by title and abstract relevance, followed by full-text reading, resulting in 5 articles included in the final synthesis.
- **Results:** Main findings, including:
  - Number of studies included  
  - Main results
- **Conclusions:** Main conclusions and implications for practice and research.

## 3. Introduction

- **Context:** Detailed description of the problem and motivation for the review.  
  - Software development teams working in fast-paced environments face growing pressure to deliver reliable systems on shorter release cycles. In that context, DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines have become essential to sustain continuous delivery while preserving software quality. Yet the efficiency of those pipelines depends directly on how well integration tests perform—a critical stage that validates interactions among services, databases, external APIs, and internal modules.
  In financial technology (fintech) settings, that challenge is even sharper. Highly distributed systems, strict regulatory demands, and very low tolerance for failure call for strong, well-monitored testing strategies. Even so, many teams still lack objective data to see where time is lost in their pipelines, which tools fit their context best, and what countermeasures can ease productivity bottlenecks. Integration-test metrics offer a strategic way to close those gaps. By systematically gathering and analyzing measures such as test run time, pipeline duration, failure rate, and developer feedback time, teams can make evidence-based decisions that directly improve delivery speed and software reliability.
- **Objectives:** Research questions or specific objectives.  
  - RQ-1: During software development, what are the main productivity and time bottlenecks correlated with integration testing metrics, and what countermeasures should be applied to reduce their impact on productivity and final delivery?
  - RQ-2: How can the use of metrics accelerate the software delivery process and improve quality, ensuring greater reliability based on concrete data and making the process more efficient?
  - RQ-3: What is the importance of identifying the most efficient testing tools for the financial market?
- **Justification:** Importance of the review and expected impact. 
  - The relevance of this review lies in the growing adoption of DevOps practices within fintech companies and the lack of consolidated evidence on which metrics and tools most effectively optimize change-validation time in integration pipelines. Understanding these factors is essential not only for improving internal development efficiency, but also for reducing costs, minimizing failure risks, and accelerating time-to-market in a highly regulated sector.
    Furthermore, identifying the most suitable testing tools for the financial market prevents teams from investing time and resources in low-impact solutions, contributing directly to more productive and reliable development workflows. This review aims to synthesize existing evidence and provide actionable insights for both practitioners and researchers working at the intersection of DevOps, software testing, and financial systems.
