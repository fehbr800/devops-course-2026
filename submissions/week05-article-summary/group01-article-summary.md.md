## 1. Paper 1 — GitOps and CD in Financial Software

**Citation (short):** *GitOps and Continuous Delivery in Financial Software: Best Practices for Efficient DevOps Pipelines*  
**Authors:** Ashmitha Nagraj  
**Year:** 2022  
**Source:** Frontiers in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence (Al-Kindi Publishers)

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this paper is to analyze the adoption of GitOps and Continuous Delivery practices within fintech companies, examining the transition from legacy development methods to CI/CD-based pipelines. The study focuses on how these practices can improve efficiency, security, auditability, and resilience in financial software delivery, and how DevSecOps can be embedded throughout the pipeline to meet regulatory and compliance requirements.

### 1.2 Method

The paper uses a literature-based and case-study-oriented approach. It reviews academic and industry research related to GitOps, Continuous Delivery, DevOps, DevSecOps, financial cloud systems, microservices modernization, and secure software pipelines. The study organizes the reviewed material into practical areas including DevSecOps in FinTech, legacy system modernization, pipeline integrity and automation, leadership and organizational change, and efficiency metrics. Case studies from financial organizations such as ING NL and Capital One are synthesized to illustrate practical outcomes.

### 1.3 Results

The paper concludes that GitOps and Continuous Delivery, when combined with DevSecOps, significantly improve the efficiency, security, auditability, and resilience of financial software delivery pipelines. Key findings include:

- GitOps improves consistency and auditability by using Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure configurations.
- Continuous Delivery enables automated and repeatable deployment processes, reducing manual work and allowing financial organizations to release software more frequently and reliably.
- DevSecOps strengthens security and compliance by embedding SAST, DAST, vulnerability scanning, secret management, and automated compliance gates directly into the pipeline.
- Legacy modernization through containerization and microservices is recommended as an incremental path to reduce downtime and improve deployment flexibility.
- ING NL reported deployment improvements of approximately 20–30% after adopting more automated CI/CD practices.
- Remaining challenges include legacy systems, fragmented toolchains, regulatory compliance demands, cultural resistance, and the complexity of cloud-native financial environments.

## 2. Paper 2 — Systematic Review of KPIs in Modern DevOps

**Citation (short):** *Systematic Review of Key Performance Metrics in Modern DevOps and Software Reliability Engineering*  
**Authors:** Andrew I. Daraojimba, Denis Kisina, Oluwasanmi S. Adanigbo, Bright C. Ubanadu  
**Year:** 2024  
**Source:** Journal of Future Engineering

### 2.1 Objective

The objective of this paper is to review and organize the key performance metrics used in DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) practices. The authors aim to explain how these metrics evolved, how they are applied in real software engineering environments, and how they support continuous improvement, system reliability, and better decision-making. The paper also seeks to highlight the complementary relationship between DevOps and SRE.

### 2.2 Method

The authors used a systematic review methodology following the PRISMA framework. They searched academic databases including IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, as well as industry materials from DORA, Google Cloud, CNCF, Microsoft, and ThoughtWorks. Starting from 174 sources, they selected 67 high-quality studies for final analysis after abstract screening and full-text evaluation. Metrics were grouped into thematic categories including deployment performance, system reliability, user experience, automation efficiency, and operational response.

### 2.3 Results

The review found that the most impactful DevOps metrics align with the DORA model:

- **Deployment frequency:** how often new code is deployed to production.
- **Lead time for changes:** time from code commit to production deployment.
- **Change failure rate:** percentage of deployments that cause incidents.
- **Mean time to recovery (MTTR):** how quickly service is restored after a failure.

For SRE, the paper identifies three central concepts: Service-Level Indicators (SLIs), Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), and error budgets. Companies such as Google, Netflix, and Amazon use these metrics to support reliability, automation, and continuous deployment. Identified challenges include metric overload, poorly aligned KPIs, and cultural resistance to metric-driven practices. Future directions include better metric standardization, AI for predictive observability, and human-centered metrics such as developer well-being.

## 3. Paper 3 — DevOps Maturity Framework

**Citation (short):** *A DevOps Maturity Framework for Enhancing Cross-Functional Collaboration and Continuous Deployment Efficiency*  
**Authors:** Taiwo Oyewole, David A. Akokodaripon, Odunayo M. Babatope, Winner Mayo  
**Year:** 2023  
**Source:** International Journal of Engineering Management and Technology (IJEMT)

### 3.1 Objective

The objective of this paper is to propose a comprehensive DevOps maturity framework that helps organizations assess and improve their DevOps capabilities, with emphasis on cross-functional collaboration and continuous deployment efficiency. The study argues that maturity depends on the alignment of culture, processes, technology, governance, and performance measurement — not only on tool adoption.

### 3.2 Method

The paper uses a review-based and comparative analysis approach, examining existing DevOps maturity models including CALMS, DORA, and Gartner's capability maturity model. Based on this review, the authors propose a five-level framework evaluated through three dimensions: People (culture, leadership, skills), Process (workflow orchestration, agile practices, governance), and Technology (CI/CD automation, containerization, monitoring, DevSecOps). Tools reviewed include Jenkins, GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, and SonarQube.

### 3.3 Results

The paper presents a five-level maturity model (Initial → Managed → Defined → Quantitatively Controlled → Optimized) as a diagnostic and strategic tool for software delivery improvement. Mature DevOps organizations share characteristics such as strong collaboration between Dev, Ops, QA, and Security teams; automated CI/CD pipelines; measurable performance indicators (deployment frequency, lead time, MTTR, change failure rate); and DevSecOps integration. The paper concludes that higher DevOps maturity improves deployment efficiency, strengthens collaboration, increases system reliability, and aligns technical agility with business objectives.

**Citation (short):** *Decision-Making in Agile Software Engineering: A Systematic Literature Review of Models, Methods, Actors and Lifecycle Contexts*  
**Authors:** H. Sain, T. Sutiknio, I. Riadi  
**Year:** 2025  
**Source:** MDPI Software

### 9.1 Objective

The objective of this paper is to consolidate and structure existing research on decision-making in agile software engineering. The authors argue that decision-making is central to agile development but the literature remains fragmented across different models, methods, roles, lifecycle stages, and contexts. The study aims to identify how decisions are made in agile environments, which models and techniques are used, who participates, where in the lifecycle decisions occur, and what benefits and challenges are reported.

### 9.2 Method

The paper uses a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) methodology following the Kitchenham guidelines and the SEGRESS framework (based on PRISMA, adapted for software engineering). The authors searched four major academic databases: IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science, covering studies published from 2014 to 2024, complemented by backward and forward snowballing. After screening, duplicate removal, and full-text analysis, 42 studies were selected for final synthesis. Studies were analyzed using a structured coding scheme classifying literature by research methodology, decision-making type, models, methods, actors, lifecycle context, and reported benefits and challenges.

### 9.3 Results

- Research on agile decision-making is concentrated mainly in planning and requirements-related activities.
- Analytical and hybrid decision-making models are most commonly reported, especially in backlog prioritization, release planning, architectural decisions, and risk assessment.
- Software developers are the most frequently studied decision-making actors; managers appear mainly as external or strategic stakeholders.
- Later lifecycle stages — coding, testing, release, and operations — are underexplored, as decision-making in these stages tends to be implicit and experience-based.
- Identified benefits include improved prioritization, better collaboration, more transparent decision processes, and stronger alignment between technical work and project goals.
- Identified challenges include fragmented terminology, inconsistent decision models, limited attention to managerial roles, and insufficient research on decision-making during implementation and quality assurance.
- The main contribution is a structured synthesis across models, methods, actors, and lifecycle contexts, with a proposed 5W1H nomenclature to support future comparative research.
